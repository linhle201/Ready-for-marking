Program 3 â€“ Imperial to Metric Conversion

Write a console program that converts a weight given in tons (imperial), stones, pounds, and ounces to the metric equivalent in metric tons, kilograms, and grams. Begin by designing your solution to this problem in pseudocode, which will be submitted along with the program.
After the numbers of tons, stones, pounds, and ounces are input by the user, the weight should be converted entirely into ounces (the lowest common denominator) and then divided by 35.274 to obtain the value in kilos. The JavaScript parseInt function should be used to break the total number of kilos into a whole number of metric tons and kilos. The number of grams should be displayed to one decimal place.
Required formulas:
total ounces = 35840 * tons + 224 * stone + 16 * pounds + ounces
total kilos = total ounces / 35.274
metric tons = Int(kilos/1000)
