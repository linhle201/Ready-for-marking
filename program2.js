Program 2- Weekly Loan Calculator
Develop a short term loan calculator program as a console application with the following specifications. Begin by designing your solution to this problem in pseudocode, which will be submitted along with the program.
If A dollars are borrowed at r% interest compounded weekly to purchase something with weekly payments for n years, then the weekly payment is given by the formula:
i  = 	     r     
  5200	
If:


Then calculate the weekly payment as:
weekly payment  = 	          i          
1 â€“ (1 + i)-52n	* A

Write a console application that calculates the weekly payment after the user gives the amount of the loan, interest rate, and number of years.
